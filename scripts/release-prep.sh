cat <<EOF
release-prep complete for v$VERSION (just ci passed).

Next steps:
  1. Review the diff: git diff
  2. Commit:          git commit -am 'chore(release): prepare $VERSION'
  3. Push branch and open a PR; wait for CI green and owner merge.
  4. After merge, from main:
       git tag -s v$VERSION -m v$VERSION
       git push origin v$VERSION
  5. Approve the publish job in the GitHub Actions UI when the
     'release' Environment gate prompts for owner review.

See docs/release-process.md for the full procedure.
